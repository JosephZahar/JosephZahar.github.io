Hello! I’m Joseph, a [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu) postgraduate specializing in AI,
I have a solid foundation in data science and business analytics from 
[Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk), complemented by undergraduate studies in 
Biomedical Engineering at [Queen Mary University of London](https://www.qmul.ac.uk). 

Professionally, I've made significant contributions across various roles. At Medtronic's 
Digital Surgery, I innovated in R&D, leveraging machine learning to annotate 
surgical approaches and streamline data visuals. As a Data Science Lead 
at Hostelworld Group, I led a team to optimize digital advertising ROI, 
deploying advanced LSTM models. My entrepreneurial spirit shone as a 
Co-Founder at Za’ta, where we developed a cashierless payment system and 
data-driven inventory models. My experience at OrderPay further solidified 
my expertise in data analytics, where I enhanced deployed dashboards and 
automated reporting processes.
